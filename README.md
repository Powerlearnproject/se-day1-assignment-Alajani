Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of real world solutions to real world and challenging problems.It is useful in creation of real world applications 
that helps in making modern world much more easier.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages
2. Establishment of software as a discipline in 1960
3. The rise of agile technology in 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement: Knowing the need ad need assessment.
2. Design: Detailed design of the software is done.
3. Implemmentation: Buildiong the model by writing code to fit the design and optimization.
4. Testing: Various tests on the application and solutin developed.
5. Deployment: At this stage the idea implemented is being passed out to the public for usage.
6. Maintenance: to give support and update the exsiting model.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall uses sequential approach with distint phases while Agile uses iterative approach which focus on flexibilty and opened to changes 
over time.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Softtware Developer: Writes the code and implement the idea and software
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensure quality of codes written and execute plans and timely execution .
Project Manager: Planning, Execution and delivery of the project at he given timefram

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Provides tools for writing debugging and testing codes (Visual Video Code) 
Version Control Systems(VCS): TRacts changes in soures and contol as well as means for keeping data of engineerings for future references e.g Git, SubVersion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges includes
1. Changes in ideas
2. changes in timeline for execution of project
3. Lack of resourecs
4. poor timeline for execution: Projects should be timed adequately to ensure quality work


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit: Testng Individual Components or module
2. Integration: Testing with different component 
3. System: Testing with the whole software system 
4. Acceptance: Testing against users requirement


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Enginnering is a wAY OF CRAFTING questions and prompts ti get the best possible answer for the problem. This helps AI to process the prompt better
and provide the best possible amswer for the problem

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
hello, can you please give me  comprehensive list of components need to design a simple solar driven circuit
